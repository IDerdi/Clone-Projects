# Clone-Projects

  Throughout the project, I gradually built the page structure, style, and interactions using fundamental web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I paid attention to details for user experience and visual appeal, aiming to provide users with an experience reminiscent of the original website.

  Creating a clone web page goes beyond developing technical skills. These projects offer opportunities to enhance problem-solving abilities, teamwork, and creativity. Pushing your boundaries in your own project gives you a fresh perspective and boosts your confidence.
